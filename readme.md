Something I worked on in Nov of 2021, used https://dev.azure.com/ as remote repo at that time.
Here on github just for ... idk.

https://github.com/mienaiyami/learning-opengl-cpp

Note to self: removing .git for ./lighting ./Project1 ./model loading and ./triangle to push on github without submodules and subtree pain. Original git logs are still on dev.azure.com.
